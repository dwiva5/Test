# Welcome to our Rainfall-Runoff repository!

This is a Gitlab repository for the course CEGM2003 Data Science and Artificial Intelligence for Engineers, created by the HBV group with members; 
Dwiva Anbiya Taruna (5849578), Konstantina Bourazani (5728347), Hang Long (5743702) and Thomas Poort (4715500). The project focuses on rainfall-runoff 
modeling using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models and aims to address the lack of uncertainty estimations in hydrological predictions.

## Rainfall-runoff modeling

While hydrological predictions are fundamental for effective water resource management, the lack of uncertainty estimations poses a significant challenge. 
Existing applications predominantly focus on point forecasts, overlooking the critical need for estimating the associated confidence levels. This gap in 
uncertainty consideration hinders informed decision-making. Moreover, the absence of dedicated metrics for evaluating uncertainty estimation further compounds 
the issue. 

For this reason a LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model was trained based on imported CAMELS data for the United States, specifically for Hydrological Unit 17 
 (HUC 17) which has data for basins in the North-West upper corner of the United States (namely the states Washington, Oregon).
As the LSTM model itself only returns deterministic results (one discharge prediction per timestep), four different methods were used to obtain
uncertainty estimation; Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD), Gaussian Mixture Density Network (GMM), Uncountable Mixture of Asymmetric Laplacians (UMAL) and Countable 
Mixture of Asymmetric Laplacians (CMAL). Based on the results of these methods uncertainty intervals were created and 
these were evaluated by newly introduced evaluation metrics, the PICP (Prediction Interval Coverage Probability) and PINAW (Prediction Interval Normalized 
Average Width). By computing the uncertainty interval of the methods we hope to bridge the gap in knowledge that currently exists due to the fact that
only deterministic results are predicted. Furthermore, by evaluating these uncertainty estimations and creating the evaluation metrics we try
to estimate what indeed is the best way to model rainfall runoff.

Additionally, the result of the ensemble of the predictions was compared to just the deterministic results of the LSTM. And Transfer Learning was used as well
to assess whether the trained model, trained by data from HUC 17, could also make accurate prediction for basins from another HUC.

## Where can the used files be found

#### Data:

- Folder: 'data'

    The data used for the proejct can be found under the data folder. In this folder CAMELSUS data can be found which
    consists of three main datasets; the basin_mean_forcing containing all the meteorological time series data, usgs_streamflow
    containing the streamflow data and camels_attribute_v2.0 that extracts all the basin attributes.
    This data was imported for both HUC 17 and HUC 18.

#### Models: 

- Folder: 'neuralhydrology/modelzoo'

    Under the neuralhydrology folder, there is a subfolder called modelzoo. This folder contains a cudalstm.py file that has the coded
    LSTM model stored there as well as a head.py file which contains the coding for the MCD, GMM, UMAL and CMAL.

#### Notebooks:

- Folder: 'Project-Run'

    The notebooks that were used to actually use the data and models are stored in the Project-Run file. 

#### Evaluation Metrics:

- Folder: 'neuralhydrology/evaluation/metrics.py'

    Lastly, the introduced evaluation metrics such as the PICP and PINAW can be found under neuralhydrology/evaluation/metrics.py in which all
    the available metrics are stored.

## Original Repository

As a forked repository from Neuralhydrology gitlab was used for this project the original README file of that repository is included at the end
of this README as an appendix.

Python library to train neural networks with a strong focus on hydrological applications.

This package has been used extensively in research over the last years and was used in various academic publications. 
The core idea of this package is modularity in all places to allow easy integration of new datasets, new model 
architectures or any training-related aspects (e.g. loss functions, optimizer, regularization). 
One of the core concepts of this code base are configuration files, which let anyone train neural networks without
touching the code itself. The NeuralHydrology package is built on top of the deep learning framework 
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), since it has proven to be the most flexible and useful for research purposes.

We (the AI for Earth Science group at the Institute for Machine Learning, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria) are using
this code in our day-to-day research and will continue to integrate our new research findings into this public repository.
